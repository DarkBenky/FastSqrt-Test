# Square Root Benchmarking

This project benchmarks three different implementations of the square root function in Go:

1. **StandardSqrt**: Uses the standard library's `math.Sqrt` function.
2. **IterativeSqrt**: Uses 5 iterations of Newton's method.
3. **OptimizedSqrt**: Uses bit manipulation for an optimized approximation.

## Benchmark Results

The benchmarks were run using the command `go test -bench=.` on the following system:

## Conclusion

The results show that the standard library's `math.Sqrt` function (`StandardSqrt`) and the optimized bit manipulation method (`OptimizedSqrt`) are significantly faster than the iterative method (`IterativeSqrt`). However, the differences between `StandardSqrt` and `OptimizedSqrt` are minimal.

It is generally not recommended to implement your own square root function unless you have a very specific need that the standard library does not meet. The standard library's `math.Sqrt` function is highly optimized and should be preferred for most use cases.

To run the benchmarks yourself, use the following command:
